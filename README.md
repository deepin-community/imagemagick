Legacy [ImageMagickÂ®](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/) is a free and [open-source](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/license.php) software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster image and vector image files. It can read and write over 200 image file [formats](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/formats.php), and can support a wide range of image manipulation operations, such as resizing, cropping, and color correction.

#### What is ImageMagick?

ImageMagick is written in C and is available for a wide range of operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can be used as a standalone application, or as a library that can be integrated into other software programs.

The main website for legacy ImageMagick can be found at [https://legacy.imagemagick.org](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/). The source code for this software can be accessed through the repository located at [https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick6](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick6). In addition, a more recent version of ImageMagick, version 7, can be found at [https://imagemagick.org](https://imagemagick.org/).

#### Features and Capabilities

One of the key features of ImageMagick is its support for scripting and automation. This allows users to create complex image manipulation pipelines that can be run automatically, without the need for manual intervention. This can be especially useful for tasks that require the processing of large numbers of images, or for tasks that need to be performed on a regular basis.

In addition to its core image manipulation capabilities, ImageMagick also includes a number of other features, such as support for animation, color management, and image rendering. These features make it a versatile tool for a wide range of image-related tasks, including graphic design, scientific visualization, and digital art.

Overall, ImageMagick is a powerful and versatile software suite for displaying, converting, and editing image files. Its support for scripting and automation, along with its other features, make it a valuable tool for a wide range of image-related tasks.

Here are just a few [examples](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/examples.php) of what ImageMagick can do:

[Examples of ImageMagick Usage](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/Usage/), demonstrates how to use the software from the [command line](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php) to achieve various effects. There are also several scripts available on the website called [Fred's ImageMagick Scripts](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/), which can be used to apply geometric transforms, blur and sharpen images, remove noise, and perform other operations. Additionally, there is a tool called [Magick.NET](https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET) that allows users to access the functionality of ImageMagick without having to install the software on their own systems. Finally, the website also includes a [Cookbook](http://im.snibgo.com/) with tips and examples for using ImageMagick on Windows systems.

#### News

ImageMagick best practices **strongly** encourages you to configure a [security policy](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php) that suits your local environment.

Now that ImageMagick [version 7](https://imagemagick.org) is released, we recommend upgrading from version 6. Learn how ImageMagick version 7 differs from previous versions with our [porting guide](https://imagemagick.org/script/porting.php).

Want more performance from ImageMagick? Try these options:

* add more memory to your system, see the [pixel cache](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#cache);
* add more cores to your system, see [threads of execution support](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#threads);
* reduce lock contention with the [tcmalloc](http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html) memory allocation library;
* push large images to a solid-state drive, see [large image support](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#tera-pixel).

If these options are prohibitive, you can reduce the quality of the image results. The default build is Q16 HDRI. If you disable [HDRI](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/high-dynamic-range.php), you use half the memory and instead of predominantly floating point operations, you use the typically more efficient integer operations. The tradeoff is reduced precision and you cannot process out of range pixel values (e.g. negative). If you build the Q8 non-HDRI version of ImageMagick, you again reduce the memory requirements in half-- and once again there is a tradeoff, even less precision and no out of range pixel values. For a Q8 non-HDRI build of ImageMagick, use these configure script options: --with-quantum-depth=8 --disable-hdri.
